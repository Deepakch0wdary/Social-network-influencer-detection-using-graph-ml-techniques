Mini project 
# Social Network Influencer Detection Using Graph Machine Learning Techniques

## 📌 Overview
This project detects key influencers in social networks using Graph Machine Learning (GML) models such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT).  
It moves beyond traditional centrality metrics to leverage structural and semantic features in graph data.
